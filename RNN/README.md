A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential data or time series data. 
These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and image captioning; they are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, voice search, and Google Translate.
